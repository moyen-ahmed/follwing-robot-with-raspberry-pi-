# 🤖 Human-Following Robot and Autonomous Car using Raspberry Pi Pico H

## 🔍 Abstract

This project presents a **low-cost autonomous robot car** that follows a human or object using a **Raspberry Pi Pico H** microcontroller. Equipped with **ultrasonic sensors** and **Bluetooth connectivity**, it detects obstacles, adjusts its motion, and can be controlled remotely through a mobile app.

Rather than relying on complex machine learning models, the system uses **standard reactive control logic** to maintain a safe following distance and navigate its environment.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. **Initialization**: Configures GPIOs and PWM for motor and sensor control.
2. **Sensor Sweep**: Uses servo to detect object position (Left, Center, Right).
3. **Target Detection**:
   - If object is left/right → turns in that direction.
   - If object is centered → adjusts distance.
4. **Distance Adjustment**:
   - Too close → Moves backward.
   - Too far → Moves forward.
   - In range → Stops.

## 🧩 System Architecture

### 📦 Block Diagram

Power is supplied through two 7.4V Li-ion batteries. The Raspberry Pi Pico H handles all logic:
- Reads distance from ultrasonic sensors
- Sends PWM signals to motor drivers
- Interfaces with Bluetooth module for mobile commands

### 🔄 Flow Chart Overview

The robot:
- Detects the target using sensor sweep
- Determines direction and distance
- Moves accordingly while avoiding obstacles

## ⚡ Limitations

- **No object recognition**: Any object in range might be followed.
- **Sensor issues**: Affected by temperature, humidity, and surface reflectivity.
- **No path planning**: Limited to simple forward, back, and turn logic.
- **Reaction delay**: Loop delay may affect fast obstacle response.
- **Limited runtime**: Battery lasts about 1–2 hours per charge.
